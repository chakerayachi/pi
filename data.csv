 the plan risk management process should begin when a project be conceive and should be complete early in the 
 project . it may be necessary to revisit this process later in the project life cycle , for example at a major phase change , or 
 if the project scope change significantly , or if a subsequent review of risk management effectiveness determine that 
 the project risk management process require modification .

risk management plan,"the risk management plan be a component of the project management plan that describe how risk management 
 activity will be structure and perform . the risk management plan may include some or all of the follow element : 
  risk strategy . describe the general approach to manage risk on this project . 
  methodology . define the specific approach , tool , and datum source that will be use to perform risk 
 management on the project . 
  role and responsibility . define the lead , support , and risk management team member for each type of 
 activity describe in the risk management plan , and clarify their responsibility . 
  funding . identify the fund need to perform activity relate to project risk management . establishe 
 protocol for the application of contingency and management reserve . 
  timing . define when and how often the project risk management process will be perform throughout the 
 project life cycle , and establish risk management activity for inclusion into the project schedule . 
  risk category . provide a means for group individual project risk . a common way to structure risk category 
 be with a risk breakdown structure ( rbs ) , which be a hierarchical representation of potential source of risk ( see 
 example in figure 11 - 4 ) . an rbs help the project team consider the full range of source from which individual 
 project risk may arise . this can be useful when identify risk or when categorize identify risk . the 
 organization may have a generic rbs to be use for all project , or there may be several rbs framework for 
 different type of project , or the project may develop a tailor rbs . where an rbs be not use , an organization 
 may use a custom risk categorization framework , which may take the form of a simple list of category or a 
 structure base on project objective . 
 figure 11 - 4 . extract from sample risk breakdown structure ( rbs ) 
  stakeholder risk appetite . the risk appetite of key stakeholder on the project be record in the risk 
 management plan , as they inform the detail of the plan risk management process . in particular , stakeholder risk 
 appetite should be express as measurable risk threshold around each project objective . these threshold will 
 determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure , and they be also use to inform the definition of 
 probability and impact to be use when assess and prioritize individual project risk . 
  definition of risk probability and impact . definition of risk probability and impact level be specific to the 
 project context and reflect the risk appetite and threshold of the organization and key stakeholder . the project 
 may generate specific definition of probability and impact level or it may start with general definition provide 
 by the organization . the number of level reflect the degree of detail require for the project risk management 
 process , with more level use for a more detailed risk approach ( typically five level ) , and few for a simple 
 process ( usually three ) . table 11 - 1 provide an example of definition of probability and impact against three 
 project objective . these scale can be use to evaluate both threat and opportunity by interpret the impact 
 definition as negative for threat ( delay , additional cost , and performance shortfall ) and positive for opportunity 
 ( reduce time or cost , and performance enhancement ) . 
 table 11 - 1 . example of definition for probability and impact 
  probability and impact matrix . describe in section 11.3.2.6 . prioritization rule may be specify by the 
 organization in advance of the project and be include in organizational process asset , or they may be tailor to 
 the specific project . opportunity and threat be represent in a common probability and impact matrix use 
 positive definition of impact for opportunity and negative impact definition for threat . descriptive term 
 ( such as very high , high , medium , low , and very low ) or numeric value can be use for probability and impact . 
 where numeric value be use , these can be multiply to give a probability - impact score for each risk , which 
 allow the relative priority of individual risk to be evaluate within each priority level . an example probability and 
 impact matrix be present in figure 11 - 5 , which also show a possible numeric risk scoring scheme .

 be document , analyze , and communicate . this section of the risk management plan describe the content 
 and format of the risk register and the risk report , as well as any other require output from the project risk 
 management process .

 identify risk consider both individual project risk and source of overall project risk . participant in risk 
 identification activity may include the follow : project manager , project team member , project risk specialist 
 ( if assign ) , customer , subject matter expert from outside the project team , end user , other project manager , 
 operation manager , stakeholder , and risk management expert within the organization . while these personnel be 
 often key participant for risk identification , all project stakeholder should be encourage to identify individual project 
 risk . it be particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense of ownership and 
 responsibility for identify individual project risk , the level of overall project risk , and associate risk response action . 
 when describe and record individual project risk , a consistent format should be use for risk statement to 
 ensure that each risk be understand clearly and unambiguously in order to support effective analysis and risk response 
 development . risk owner for individual project risk may be nominate as part of the identify risk process , and will 
 be confirm during the perform qualitative risk analysis process . preliminary risk response may also be identify 
 and record and will be review and confirm as part of the plan risk response process . 
 identify risk be an iterative process , since new individual project risk may emerge as the project progress through 
 its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change . the frequency of iteration and participation in each risk 
 identification cycle will vary by situation , and this will be define in the risk management plan .

  root cause analysis . root cause analysis ( see section 8.2.2.2 ) be typically use to discover the underlie 
 cause that lead to a problem , and develop preventive action . it can be use to identify threat by start with a 
 problem statement ( for example , the project might be delay or over budget ) and explore which threat might 
 result in that problem occur . the same technique can be use to find opportunity by start with a benefit 
 statement ( for example , early delivery or under budget ) and explore which opportunity might result in that 
 benefit be realize . 
  assumption and constraint analysis . every project and its project management plan be conceive 
 and develop base on a set of assumption and within a series of constraint . these be often already 
 incorporate in the scope baseline and project estimate . assumption and constraint analysis explore the 
 validity of assumption and constraint to determine which pose a risk to the project . threat may be identify 
 from the inaccuracy , instability , inconsistency , or incompleteness of assumption . constraint may give rise to 
 opportunity through remove or relax a limit factor that affect the execution of a project or process . 
  swot analysis . this technique examine the project from each of the strength , weakness , opportunity , 
 and threat ( swot ) perspective . for risk identification , it be use to increase the breadth of identify risk by 
 include internally generate risk . the technique start with the identification of strength and weakness 
 of the organization , focus on either the project , organization , or the business area in general . swot analysis 
 then identify any opportunity for the project that may arise from strength , and any threat result from 
 weakness . the analysis also examine the degree to which organizational strength may offset threat and 
 determine if weakness might hinder opportunity .

 perform qualitative risk analysis assess the priority of identify individual project risk use their probability of 
 occurrence , the corresponding impact on project objective if the risk occur , and other factor . such assessment be 
 subjective as they be base on perception of risk by the project team and other stakeholder . effective assessment 
 therefore require explicit identification and management of the risk attitude of key participant in the perform 
 qualitative risk analysis process . risk perception introduce bias into the assessment of identify risk , so attention 
 should be pay to identify bias and correct for it . where a facilitator be use to support the perform qualitative 
 risk analysis process , address bias be a key part of the facilitator ’s role . an evaluation of the quality of the available 
 information on individual project risk also help to clarify the assessment of each risk ’s importance to the project . 
 perform qualitative risk analysis establish the relative priority of individual project risk for plan risk response . 
 it identify a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility for plan an appropriate risk response and ensure 
 that it be implement . perform qualitative risk analysis also lay the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis

strategy for threat,"five alternative strategy may be consider for deal with threat , as follows : 
  escalate . escalation be appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agree that a threat be outside 
 the scope of the project or that the propose response would exceed the project manager ’s authority . escalate 
 risk be manage at the program level , portfolio level , or other relevant part of the organization , and not on the 
 project level . the project manager determine who should be notify about the threat and communicate the 
 detail to that person or part of the organization . it be important that ownership of escalate threat be accept 
 by the relevant party in the organization . threat be usually escalate to the level that match the objective 
 that would be affect if the threat occur . escalate threat be not monitor far by the project team after 
 escalation , although they may be record in the risk register for information . 
  avoid . risk avoidance be when the project team act to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its 
 impact . it may be appropriate for high - priority threat with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative 
 impact . avoidance may involve change some aspect of the project management plan or change the objective 
 that be in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely , reduce its probability of occurrence to zero . the 
 risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objective from the risk ’s impact if it be to occur . 
 example of avoidance action may include remove the cause of a threat , extend the schedule , change the 
 project strategy , or reduce scope . some risk can be avoid by clarify requirement , obtain information , 
 improve communication , or acquire expertise . 
  transfer . transfer involve shift ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the 
 impact if the threat occur . risk transfer often involve payment of a risk premium to the party take on the 
 threat . transfer can be achieve by a range of action , which include but be not limit to the use of insurance , 
 performance bond , warranty , guarantee , etc . agreement may be use to transfer ownership and liability for 
 specify risk to another party . 
  mitigate . in risk mitigation , action be take to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat . early 
 mitigation action be often more effective than try to repair the damage after the threat have occur . adopt 
 less complex process , conduct more test , or choose a more stable seller be example of mitigation 
 action . mitigation may involve prototype development ( see section 5.2.2.8 ) to reduce the risk of scale up from 
 a bench - scale model of a process or product . where it be not possible to reduce probability , a mitigation response 
 might reduce the impact by target factor that drive the severity . for example , design redundancy into a 
 system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component . 
  accept . risk acceptance acknowledge the existence of a threat , but no proactive action be take . this strategy 
 may be appropriate for low - priority threat , and it may also be adopt where it be not possible or cost - effective 
 to address a threat in any other way . acceptance can be either active or passive . the most common active 
 acceptance strategy be to establish a contingency reserve , include amount of time , money , or resource to 
 handle the threat if it occur . passive acceptance involve no proactive action apart from periodic review of the 
 threat to ensure that it do not change significantly .

strategy for opportunity,"five alternative strategy may be consider for deal with opportunity , as follows : 
  escalate . this risk response strategy be appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agree that 
 an opportunity be outside the scope of the project or that the propose response would exceed the project 
 manager ’s authority . escalate opportunity be manage at the program level , portfolio level , or other relevant 
 part of the organization , and not on the project level . the project manager determine who should be notify 
 about the opportunity and communicate the detail to that person or part of the organization . it be important 
 that ownership of escalate opportunity be accept by the relevant party in the organization . opportunity 
 be usually escalate to the level that match the objective that would be affect if the opportunity occur . 
 escalate opportunity be not monitor far by the project team after escalation , although they may be 
 record in the risk register for information . 
  exploit . the exploit strategy may be select for high - priority opportunity where the organization want to 
 ensure that the opportunity be realize . this strategy seek to capture the benefit associate with a particular 
 opportunity by ensure that it definitely happen , increase the probability of occurrence to 100 % . example of 
 exploiting response may include assign an organization ’s most talented resource to the project to reduce 
 the time to completion , or use new technology or technology upgrade to reduce cost and duration . 
  share . share involve transfer ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it share some of the 
 benefit if the opportunity occur . it be important to select the new owner of a share opportunity carefully so they 
 be well able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project . risk sharing often involve payment of a 
 risk premium to the party take on the opportunity . example of share action include form risk - share 
 partnership , team , special - purpose company , or joint venture . 
  enhance . the enhance strategy be use to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity . early 
 enhancement action be often more effective than try to improve the benefit after the opportunity have occur . 
 the probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increase by focus attention on its cause . where it 
 be not possible to increase probability , an enhancement response might increase the impact by target factor 
 that drive the size of the potential benefit . example of enhance opportunity include add more resource 
 to an activity to finish early . 
  accept . accept an opportunity acknowledge its existence but no proactive action be take . this strategy may 
 be appropriate for low - priority opportunity , and it may also be adopt where it be not possible or cost - effective 
 to address an opportunity in any other way . acceptance can be either active or passive . the most common active 
 acceptance strategy be to establish a contingency reserve , include amount of time , money , or resource to take 
 advantage of the opportunity if it occur . passive acceptance involve no proactive action apart from periodic 
 review of the opportunity to ensure that it do not change significantly .

contingent response strategy,"some response be design for use only if certain event occur . for some risk , it be appropriate for the project 
 team to make a response plan that will only be execute under certain predefine condition , if it be believe that 
 there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan . event that trigger the contingency response , such as miss 
 intermediate milestone or gain high priority with a seller , should be define and track . risk response 
 identify use this technique be often call contingency plan or fallback plan and include identify trigger 
 event that set the plan in effect . 
 ",fallback plan,[],be,"['implement risk response', 'plan risk management', 'risk management plan']","['contingency', 'risk', 'response', 'event', 'trigger']"
strategy for overall project risk,"risk response should be plan and implement not only for individual project risk but also to address overall 
 project risk . the same risk response strategy that be use to deal with individual project risk can also be apply to 
 overall project risk : 
  avoid . where the level of overall project risk be significantly negative and outside the agree - upon risk 
 threshold for the project , an avoid strategy may be adopt . this involve take focused action to reduce 
 the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the threshold . 
 an example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high - risk element of scope 
 from the project . where it be not possible to bring the project back within the threshold , the project may be 
 cancel . this represent the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be use only if the overall 
 level of threat be , and will remain , unacceptable . 
  exploit . where the level of overall project risk be significantly positive and outside the agree - upon risk threshold 
 for the project , an exploit strategy may be adopt . this involve take focused action to capture the positive 
 effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole . an example of exploit at the overall project level would include 
 addition of high - benefit element of scope to the project to add value or benefit to stakeholder . alternatively 
 the risk threshold for the project may be modify with the agreement of key stakeholder in order to embrace 
 the opportunity . 
  transfer / share . if the level of overall project risk be high but the organization be unable to address it effectively , 
 a third party may be involve to manage the risk on behalf of the organization . where overall project risk be 
 negative , a transfer strategy be require , which may involve payment of a risk premium . in the case of high 
 positive overall project risk , ownership may be share in order to reap the associate benefit . example of 
 both transfer and share strategy for overall project risk include but be not limit to set up a collaborative 
 business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk , launch a joint venture or 
 special - purpose company , or subcontract key element of the project . 
  mitigate / enhance . these strategy involve change the level of overall project risk to optimize the chance 
 of achieve the project ’s objective . the mitigation strategy be use where overall project risk be negative , and 
 enhancement apply when it be positive . example of mitigation or enhancement strategy include replanne 
 the project , change the scope and boundary of the project , modify project priority , change resource 
 allocation , adjust delivery time , etc . 
  accept . where no proactive risk response strategy be possible to address overall project risk , the organization 
 may choose to continue with the project as currently define , even if overall project risk be outside the agreed- 
 upon threshold . acceptance can be either active or passive . the most common active acceptance strategy be 
 to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project , include amount of time , money , or resource to be 
 use if the project exceed its threshold . passive acceptance involve no proactive action apart from periodic 
 review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it do not change significantly .

 in order to ensure that the project team and key stakeholder be aware of the current level of risk exposure , project 
 work should be continuously monitor for new , change , and outdated individual project risk and for change in 
 the level of overall project risk by apply the monitor risk process . the monitor risk process use performance 
 information generate during project execution to determine if : 
  implement risk response be effective , 
  level of overall project risk have change , 
  status of identify individual project risk have change , 
  new individual project risk have arise , 
  risk management approach be still appropriate , 
  project assumption be still valid , 
  risk management policy and procedure be be follow ,

 measure of technical performance , which can be use to compare actual result against target . such technical 
 performance measure may include weight , transaction time , number of deliver defect , storage capacity , 
 etc . deviation can indicate the potential impact of threat or opportunity . 
  reserve analysis . describe in section 7.2.2.6 . throughout execution of the project , some individual project 
 risk may occur with positive or negative impact on budget or schedule contingency reserve . reserve analysis 
 compare the amount of the contingency reserve remain to the amount of risk remain at any time in the 
 project in order to determine if the remain reserve be adequate . this may be communicate use various
